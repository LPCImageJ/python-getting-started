By default, `Eclipse` has a white and light gray theme. You can change the theme in the `Preferences` menu to a darker theme.

There's an alternative to the builtin dark theme named `Darkest Dark Theme` which looks nicer and helps with the eye strain in those large coding sessions.

To install it you need to open the `Help` menu and select `Eclipse Marketplece...`
