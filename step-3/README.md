A new window will open where you can select where do you want to fetch information about extra packages.

Next to the text that says `Work with` there's a drop down where you can select a repository of packages.

If you have downloaded `Eclipse Oxygen`, select `Oxygen`, a list of available packages will begin to load.

Once the list has finished loading, locate the `General Purpose Tools` node and expand it. Then tick the `Marketplace Client` box and click the `Next` button at the bottom.
